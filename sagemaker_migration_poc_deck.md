### Slide 2: Why We're Demoing: Addressing Your Pain Points

**Reason for Demos (Value-Focused Messaging)**

| Your Current Challenge | Our SageMaker Solution | Demo Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| üê¢ **Slow, Manual Data Prep** (Time-consuming feature engineering) | **Visual, low-code data transformation** and pipeline export. | Validate complex transformation logic. |
| üõë **Lack of Scalability/GPU Use** (Training takes days; no easy GPU access) | **Managed, on-demand GPU instances** with single-line code changes. | Demonstrate training speedup (CPU vs. GPU). |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Resource Contention** (Data scientists waiting for resources) | **Isolated, concurrent Training Jobs** with automatic resource teardown. | Show multiple jobs running without conflict. |
| üìâ **Manual Optimization** (Trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning) | **Automated Model Tuning** to efficiently find the best performing model. | Confirm objective metric and parameter ranges. |

### Slide 3: Demo 1: Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

**Service:** üõ†Ô∏è **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler**

| Section | Explanation | Key Information Gathered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Problem** | Your team spends more time **cleaning and preparing data** than building models. It's error-prone and hard to reproduce. | **Source System Connectivity** (e.g., Redshift, Snowflake, S3) |
| **The Solution** | Data Wrangler provides a **visual interface** to inspect data, apply 300+ transformations, and automatically generate the necessary code for pipelines. | **Top 3 Transformation Steps** your team currently performs manually. |
| **Key Features Shown** | 1. **Data Quality & Insights** (Quick analysis of feature distributions). 2. **No-Code Transformations** (Applying a custom logic, like missing value imputation). 3. **Export to Code** (Generating a SageMaker Processing Job script). | **Desired final Feature Set/Schema**. |

### Slide 4: Demo 2: Scalability & Concurrency

**Service:** üöÄ **Amazon SageMaker Training Jobs**

| Section | Explanation | Key Information Gathered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Problem** | Your models run on limited CPU capacity. Using GPUs is complex, and **concurrent experiments block** other data scientists. | **Current Model Framework** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) and **dependencies**. |
| **The Solution** | SageMaker manages the compute cluster (**EC2 instances**) for you. You only specify the **instance type** (CPU or GPU) and the **training script**. | **Current Average Training Time** for a specific model. |
| **Key Features Shown** | 1. **Lift-and-Shift Code:** Using a simple Python script as the `entry_point`. 2. **GPU Acceleration:** Launching the job on an `ml.m5.xlarge` (CPU) vs. `ml.g4dn.xlarge` (GPU). 3. **Concurrency:** Launching **multiple, simultaneous training jobs** using a single notebook command. | **Target Training Time** and **Maximum Concurrent Users/Jobs** needed. |

### Slide 5: Demo 3: Optimization & Efficiency

**Service:** üéØ **SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)**

| Section | Explanation | Key Information Gathered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Problem** | Manually searching for the best hyperparameters is a **labor-intensive, non-linear process** that wastes compute resources and human time. | **Key Hyperparameters** they manually tune (e.g., learning rate, epochs). |
| **The Solution** | AMT uses **Bayesian Optimization** to intelligently search the parameter space, minimizing cost and time to find the best-performing model configuration. | **Objective Metric** for model success (e.g., AUC, F1-Score). |
| **Key Features Shown** | 1. **Defining the Search Space** (`IntegerParameter`, `ContinuousParameter`). 2. **Setting the Objective** (Maximize/Minimize the target metric). 3. **Parallel Execution** (AMT automatically runs concurrent jobs to speed up the tuning process). | **Target Performance Threshold** (e.g., "We need an AUC of 0.85"). |

| **Summary: Value Delivered** | üìà **Speed:** Move models from days to hours using managed GPU training. ü§ù **Collaboration:** Concurrent jobs enable the whole team to work in parallel. üß† **Intelligence:** Automated tuning finds better models, faster, freeing up data scientist time. |
| **Key Client Input Needed** | 1. Sanitized sample dataset and data access points. 2. A simple version of a current, representative training script (`train_script.py`). 3. Confirmation on target instance types and concurrency needs. |
| **Next Steps** | ‚úÖ Finalize technical requirements based on demo feedback. üóìÔ∏è Develop a detailed Migration Plan (WBS & Timeline). ü§ù Move to Phase 1: Pilot Migration. |
